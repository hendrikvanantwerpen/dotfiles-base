Getting this stuff to start is crap. This is what seems to work on Big Sur.

Check basic syntax with:

    plutil ~/Library/LaunchAgents/SERVICE.plist

Load a service with:

    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/SERVICE.plist

Note that loading again results in an obscure I/O error. Unloading and loading again should work.

Enable the service with:

    launchctl enable gui/(id -u)/SERVICE

Kickstart the service with:

    launchctl kickstart gui/(id -u)/SERVICE

If it doesn't work, try looking at the barely existing logs:

    tail /var/log/system.log
