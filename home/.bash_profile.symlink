# .bash_profile - Interactive bash login shell

# All initialization happens in .bashrc. Figuring out a setup that works for all
# environments is too tricky: macOS runs login shells every time, Codespaces do
# not run login shells at all. Doing all initialization in .bashrc simplifies things
# significantly.
